As the first raindrops splattered against the glass, she felt a shiver run down her spine.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHer grandmother&#39;s old journal lay open on the table, its pages yellowed and frayed. It had been her last gift, a collection of cryptic entries about the town&#39;s hidden past. Tonight, she would uncover the truth. With the storm raging outside, it felt like the perfect time to dive into the stories of her ancestors, the ones that had always been murmured in hushed tones.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nJust as she reached for the journal, a loud crash echoed from the backyard. Heart pounding, she rushed to the door, the wind howling in protest. Outside, the ancient oak that had stood for centuries had fallen, revealing a hidden compartment in the earth beneath its roots.
