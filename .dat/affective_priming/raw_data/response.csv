In this study, we will ask you to respond to a open-ended question. You must be over 18 years of age to participate. The following information is important for your informed consent. 

The project is titled “Psychological Effects of Environmental Stimuli” (Protocol Number: AAAT1225) and is being run by Professor Melanie Brucks at Columbia University.The study is run to understand how behavior, such as what you purchase or how happy you feel, is a effected by various interactions in your environment. 

You were invited to participate in this study because you participated in a previous four-wave study (IRB-AAAV5832) which asked you questions about your personality and preferences. The present study is a ""substudy"" in a ""mega-study."" The purpose of this mega-study is to test the validity of using large language models to predict people's future answers based on their answers to past surveys. People colloquially refer to this prediction task as creating a ""digital twin"" of the participant. The mega-study consists of 15-20 substudies. The new data from each substudy will be provided to the investigators of AAAV5832, to complement the data available for each participant and improve the accuracy of their ""digital twin.""

Please note that there is no potential risk involved, but also the survey will provide no benefit to you in participating other than the compensation for your time.  Please make sure you read and understand the questions carefully before answering. There are no right or wrong answers, so feel free to report your answers openly and truthfully. Participation is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind. 

All information that you provide will be treated confidentially and all questions are anonymous. Furthermore, we will keep the data in a passwordlocked local device of the researcher for security. CU Human Research Protection Office and the federal Office of Human Research Protections may obtain access to the data collected for this study. 

The study will take approximately 3 minutes to complete. You will receive instructions and a code at the end of the survey to redeem your credits. 

If you have any questions about this study, you can contact mb4598@gsb.columbia.edu. Please write down this contact information or print this consent document before proceeding to the study so that you can contact the researcher should any questions or concerns arise during your participation in the study.  Moreover, if at any time you have specific questions or concerns about your rights or welfare as a study participant, contact the Columbia University Morningside Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at 212-305-5883 or email askirb@columbia.edu 

By clicking “I agree” below, you acknowledge that you understand the procedures described above, that you are at least 18 years old, and you agree to participate in this study.  Thank you for your participation.","This is an anonymous survey consisting of multiple questions. Several questions are open-ended where you need to type a few sentences. Some Prolific workers do not like answering open-ended questions and tend to quit half way or use AI to assist them when responding. Such practices would greatly compromise the data quality of our research. Thus, we ask that you please make sure that you don't mind writing and will not use AI before taking the survey. It is totally ok to just close out of the survey if you are not interested in participating.
