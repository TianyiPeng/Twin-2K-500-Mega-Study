The project is titled “Technology and Psychological Processes” (Protocol Number: AAAS7725) and is being run by Professor Melanie Brucks at Columbia University.

DESCRIPTION: You are invited to participate in a research study about technology. You will be asked to partake in various tasks and to provide your perceptions and judgments regarding the experience. You may also be asked various questions about yourself. You may be asked to interact with another person during this task. Any information you provide will remain confidential and cannot be shared with any other parties. You may be asked to complete the study using video or audio recording. If video recording will be used during the study, the study will inform you about it as well as ask for your permission. These recordings will be anonymized (i.e., not associated with your name) and maybe distributed to outside observers for evaluation.

TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation will take approximately 4 minutes.

RISKS AND BENEFITS: The risks associated with this study are minimal. This study poses no physical risks beyond those involved in normal, daily life. There is a risk of breach of confidentiality because we are collecting your indirect identifier (i.e., your Prolific or MTurk ID). Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment or grades in school. The benefits of which may reasonably be expected to result from this study are learning about psychological topics and methods and gaining understanding about your own mental processes. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.

SUBJECT'S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is not to participate. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. If videos are obtained, they will be stored on password-protected laboratory computers for up to five years after the publication of this research. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study. Identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies without additional consent from the subject.

CONFIDENTIALITY: The following people and/or agencies will be able to look at and copy your research records: - The investigator, study staff and other professionals who may be evaluating the study; - Authorities from Columbia University, including the Institutional Review Board (IRB'). An IRB is a committee organized to protect the rights and welfare of people involved in research. - The Office of Human Research Protections ('OHRP') 

CONTACT INFORMATION: If you have any questions about this study, you can contact mb4598@columbia.edu. Please write down this contact information or print this consent document before proceeding to the study so that you can contact the researcher should any questions or concerns arise during your participation in the study. Moreover, if at any time you have specific questions or concerns about your rights or welfare as a study participant, contact the Columbia University Morningside Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at 212-305-5883 or email askirb@columbia.edu.

By checking “I agree” below, you acknowledge that you understand the procedures described above and you agree to participate in this study. Thank you for your participation.","CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE

The project is titled “Technology and Psychological Processes” (Protocol Number: AAAS7725) and is being run by Professor Melanie Brucks at Columbia University.

DESCRIPTION: You were invited to participate in this study because you participated in a previous four-wave study (IRB-AAAV5832) which asked you questions about your personality and preferences. The present study is a ""substudy"" in a ""mega-study."" The purpose of this mega-study is to test the validity of using large language models to predict people's future answers based on their answers to past surveys. People colloquially refer to this prediction task as creating a ""digital twin"" of the participant. The mega-study consists of 15-20 substudies. The new data from each substudy will be provided to the investigators of AAAV5832, to complement the data available for each participant and improve the accuracy of their ""digital twin."" Note that the use of large language models will be restricted to the OpenAI platform approved by Columbia University. You may be asked to interact with another person during this task. Any information you provide will remain confidential and cannot be shared with any other parties. You may be asked to complete the study using video or audio recording. If video recording will be used during the study, the study will inform you about it as well as ask for your permission.
