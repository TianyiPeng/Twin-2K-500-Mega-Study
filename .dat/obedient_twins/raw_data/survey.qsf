The present study is a \"substudy\" in a \"mega-study.\" The purpose of this mega-study is to test the validity of using large language models to predict people's future answers based on their answers to past surveys. People colloquially refer to this prediction task as creating a \"digital twin\" of the participant. The mega-study consists of 15-20 substudies. The new data from each substudy will be provided to the investigators of AAAV5832, to complement the data available for each participant and improve the accuracy of their \"digital twin.\" Note that the use of large language models will be restricted to the OpenAI platform approved by Columbia University. You may be asked to interact with another person during this task. Any information you provide will remain confidential and cannot be shared with any other parties. You may be asked to complete the study using video or audio recording. If video recording will be used during the study, the study will inform you about it as well as ask for your permission. These recordings will be anonymized (i.e., not associated with your name) and maybe distributed to outside observers for evaluation.<br><br>TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation will take approximately 4 minutes. <br><br>RISKS AND BENEFITS: The risks associated with this study are minimal. This study poses no physical risks beyond those involved in normal, daily life. There is a risk of breach of confidentiality because we are collecting your indirect identifier (i.e., your Prolific or MTurk ID). Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your employment or grades in school.
