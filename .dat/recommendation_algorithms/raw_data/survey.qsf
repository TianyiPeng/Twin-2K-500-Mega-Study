The present study is a \"substudy\" in a \"mega-study.\" The purpose of this mega-study is to test the validity of using large language models to predict people's future answers based on their answers to past surveys. People colloquially refer to this prediction task as creating a \"digital twin\" of the participant. The mega-study consists of 15-20 substudies. The new data from each substudy will be provided to the investigators of AAAV5832, to complement the data available for each participant and improve the accuracy of their \"digital twin.\" Your answers to this study will be compared to the answers predicted based on your previous answers to AAAV5832.<br><br>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\n<br>The purpose of this research is to collect measures related to your personality and preferences and perceptions about platform recommendation systems.
