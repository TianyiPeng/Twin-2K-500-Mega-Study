You were invited to participate in this study because you participated in a previous four-wave study (IRB-AAAV5832) which asked you questions about your personality and preferences. The measures collected in this new study will also be used to create a “digital twin,” which is a large language model customized to replicate your responses.

 

Information on Research: In this study, we will ask you to answer a few questions regarding some high-end goods. You must be over 18 years of age to participate. The following information is important for your informed consent.



The project is titled “Metaverse & Digitization of Consumer Marketplace” (Protocol Number: AAAT9896) and is being run by Professor Silvia Bellezza and Kristen Lane at Columbia University, Sanghyeok Park, a PhD student at Columbia University. The study is done to understand different styles of consumption.



The study will take the amount of time that was advertised to you, which will be around 4 minutes for most participants.



Risk & Benefits: Please note that there is no potential risk involved other than a potential breach of confidentiality, but also the survey will provide no benefit to you. 



Please make sure you read and understand the questions carefully before answering. There are no right or wrong answers, so feel free to report your answers openly and truthfully. Participation is completely voluntary, and you are free to choose whether to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind. All information that you provide will be treated confidentially and all questions are anonymous. Furthermore, we will keep the data in a password-locked local device of the researcher for security. CU Human Research Protection Office and the federal Office of Human Research Protections may obtain access to the data collected for this study.



The study will take approximately 4 minutes to complete. You will receive instructions and a code at the end of the survey to redeem your credits.



If you have any questions about this study, you can contact spark24@gsb.columbia.edu. Please write down this contact information or print this consent document before proceeding to the study so that you can contact the researcher should any questions or concerns arise during your participation in the study.

Its journey is transparent, and it belongs to me in a way that goes beyond appearances. Rather than feeling lost in the crowd, I embrace the exclusivity tied to my ownership. The knowledge that my sweater is traceable, authenticated, and uniquely mine fuels a quiet confidence. It's not just about wearing a beautiful garment, it's about knowing its provenance and the individuality it represents.",,5.188,221.299,224.244,5,7,6,6,3,1,2,300,"I estimated the sweater to be $300 based on its positioning as a luxury item. When considering its luxury. high status, and prestige, I thought about factors like material quality, brand reputation, and the exclusivity tied to its digital ID and passport, which ensures authenticity and ownership transparency. This price suggests that the sweater is made with premium materials and likely ccomes from a high end fashion brand, reinforcing its luxurious appeal. Additionally, the concept of a digital passport adds another layer of perceived value, making it feel more exclusive and secure compared to a regular luxury sweater",4,2,1,1,1,,1,1,2,1954,
