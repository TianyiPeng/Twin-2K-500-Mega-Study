Start Date,End Date,Progress,Duration (in seconds),Finished,Recorded Date,"Ever wonder why you spend 15 minutes deciding what to watch on Netflix or why seasoned teams at work struggle to make tough calls? This brief 15-minute survey will help you understand and gain insights into your decision-making style!

People approach decision-making in different ways—some rely on analysis, while others trust their intuition. This research aims to explore those styles and how they develop. You’ll answer a short questionnaire about how you make decisions in your daily life, whether at work or beyond. We’ll also ask you some questions about your background.

You were invited to participate in this study because you participated in a previous four-wave study (IRB-AAAV5832) which asked you questions about your personality and preferences. The measures collected in this new study will also be used to create a “digital twin,” which is a large language model customized to replicate your responses.

The study will take approximately 15 minutes. There are no right or wrong answers. The survey is completely anonymous and no identifying information will be collected. Only the researchers involved in this study will have access to the responses you provide.

The sheer increase in complaints along with unresolved complaints makes it look like the issue is still at large and not being solved. And the increase in turnover leads me to believe the systemic dysfunction is felt severely by the people working that department. At this point I would begin to wonder if the drop in sales from 2022 to 2023 was causal or as a result of how service is being managed.,1,17,,240,1028,

From 2022 to 2023 there has been a stated decline in sales and handling internal issues Not taking the initiative to address these things will undoubtedly cause the company's demise.

There has been 100k -150k call center complaints in 2 years. In 2022 20 percent of the complaints were not resolved and the following year 45 percent of the complaints were not resolved. In 2022 the service personnel turn over was at 10 percent and the following year it rose to 25 percent. This tells me that there lack of quality training and the customer service reps are leaving in mass. This does not bode well for the company.,3,13,,217,1244,
